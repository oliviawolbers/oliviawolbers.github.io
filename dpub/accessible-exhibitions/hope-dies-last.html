        Hope Dies Last
        <div class="exhibition-info">
            <p>Some exhibitions showcase the joy in the world and offer us a sense of wonder, but as you might have guessed from the title, that's not what's going on at Hope Dies Last. Presented at Gertrude Contemporary alongside the Margaret Lawrence Gallery at the Victorian College of the Arts, this gloomy event called upon artists to consider how a world completely devoid of optimism might look. </p>
            <p>Exploring themes of mortality, fatalism, failure and ruin, some pieces demonstrate an enduring sense of compassion, while others are simply resigned to a disastrous fate. Either way, you won't find much hope here. Proudly one of the most depressing exhibitions of the year, Hope Dies Last might just leave you more pessimistic than ever. However, the exhibition is free to attend â€” so that's nice.</p>
