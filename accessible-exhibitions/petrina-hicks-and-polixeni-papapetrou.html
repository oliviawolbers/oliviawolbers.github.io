        Petrina Hicks and Polixeni Papapetrou
        <div class="exhibition-info">
            <p>This September, the NGV is showcasing two exhibitions from celebrated Australian photographers: Polixeni Papapetrou and Petrina Hicks. While the exhibitions will be separate — and give you ample time to appreciate and mull over both artists' bosy of work — they will both be on display at the Ian Potter Centre from September 26 until March 2020.</p>
            <p>Bleached Gothic is the first major survey of Hicks's work, and includes over 50 photographs and motion works from the past 15 years. Hicks explores the complexity of the female experience through enigmatic and surreal photographs. Her work poses question into the visual and cultural representation of women throughout social climates in a series of photographs relevant to the experiences of today. You'll probably recognise Shenae and Jade, which depicts a young girls with a budgie in her mouth. </p>
            <p>Papapetrou's exhibition — Olympia: Photographs by Polixeni Papapetrou — is the first major retrospective from the Australian photographer, and includes works prior to her death that have never been exhibited in Melbourne. The series showcases photographs of her daughter Olympia, from her birth until her mother's death last year, and explores the representation of children in their contemporary settings. </p> 
            <p>The dual exhibitions are a great way to get a glimpse of never before seen displays, and some of the best works, from two of Australia's best female photographers. Both exhibitions are free to attend. </p>
