        Archibald Prize 2019
        <div class="exhibition-info">
            <p>Widely touted as Australia's most prestigious portraiture prize, the Archibald Prize is a curated collection of the year's best portrait paintings. This year, the lineup includes 51 talented finalists who were selected from a record 919 entries. After an obligatory stint at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the exhibition will move to TarraWarra Museum of Art. All the winning portraits and finalists will be on display from September 14 to November 5.</p>
            <p>The works depict an eclectic mix of subjects, from celebrities and politicians to artists and authors. Tony Costa's portrait of fellow artist Lindy Lee, simply titled Lindy Lee, took out the top gong â€” and $100,000 cash along with it. Meanwhile, Tessa MacKay was awarded the 2019 Archibald Packing Room Prize, chosen by the packing room team, for her hyperreal portrait of actor David Wenham, called Through the Looking Glass. Both of which will be on display, of course. Plus, you'll see a painting by Vietnamese-Australian artist, actor and writer Anh Do, a portrait of Paralympic champion Dylan Alcott by Sydney-based stencil artist Kirpy, Carla Fletcher's cosmic work of Del Kathryn Baron and a hyperreal self-portrait of a nude, pregnant Katherine Edney.</p>
            <p>After-dark artist talks will take place throughout the exhibition period, featuring panel discussions and drinks from TarraWarra Estate, Watts River Brewing and Four Pillars Gin.</p>
